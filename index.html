              Hey there, welcome to my page about me and my programming career.
              I'm Patrick Le, currently a final year student in a Bachelor of
              Engineering (Honours) Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice
              (Electrical) at UTS who wanted to document the journey and path I
              took into the world of software development.

              Although I didn't start out my professional career in the field of
              programming, I knew that my first steps into the industry were the
              right choice for where I was back when I first started at
              university to where I am now, a full-stack developer at one of the
              biggest banks in Australia.

                If you're looking to find out more about me, then you've come to
                the right place. You can navigate around to check out my
                past experiences,
                future goals and other information
                about me. I've also created a
                comments section if you would like
                any insight on how I went about creating these pages.

                I've also placed some handy navigational links right below to if
                you dont want to move that mouse all the way back to the top of
                the screen (don't worry I know how much effort it is to move the
                mouse all day!!!).
