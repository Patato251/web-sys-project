            and strategies employed to meet several critieria in regards to the

          <p>
            After working on the creation of each page, the amount of work and
            effort required was significantly more that what I was expecting. I
            had underestimated the difficulty and the sheer extent of work
            required, however after completing these pages, I have a newfound
            respect for the level of attention and detail that is required to
            create a aesthetic and functional page. The work spanned multiple
            days worth of planning and troubleshooting, with the final result
            being the given pages as seen.

          <!-- #region Technical Aspects-->
          <h3 class="subHeader">Technical Aspects</h3>
          <p>
            The following section outlines the general technical aspects and
            considerations that were taken into account whilst creating each
            page. Several subsections will be used to outline independent
            aspects and components used.
          </p>

          <h4>Website Structure and Outline</h4>
          <p>
            The general website itself consisted of 5 primary files, 4 html
            pages for each respective page of a home page, past page, future
            page and comments page, followed by a singular css stylesheet. The
            following table outlines a brief description for each file:
          </p>
          <table class="contentTable">
            <tr class="tableHeader">

              <td>StyleSheet File</td>

                class and page.
              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>

          <p>
            For each of the respective HTML pages, the general layout was as
            follows in order to create a consistent user experience and easily
            readable site:
          </p>
          <img
            id="structureImage"
            src="/Assets/pageStructure.jpg"
            alt="Page Structure"
          />
          <p>
            The layout as shown above can be broken down into four major
            components, each with a specified purpose and functionality. It is
            as follows:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Site Header (h1 Tag class: siteHeader)
              <br />
              <p>
                The primary header that is displayed across each page, it is
                shown within the diagram in the blue colour highlight. The
                header itself is used to display the respective subject number
                and subject name. It is displayed within the page as the largest
                element, currently represented by a &lt;h1&gt; tag. The tag
                itself is managed by the "siteHeader" class within the
                stylesheet, and has alignment centred across all pages. It is
                also affected as standard by the "body" styling of the whole
                website, with font-size being enlarged and the font family being
                Verdana.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Navigational Bar (Div class: navBar)
              <br />
              <p>
                The main form of navigation between each webpage. The
                navigational bar is shown across each page similarly to the
                header component, represented as the yellow highlight within the
                diagram. It is represented with the a div container using the
                class "navbar", with several anchor tags within it for traversal
                between pages. Inside this navBar class, the margins, position,
                and general look of the navigational bar itself are all
                configured within the class styling (background-color, border
                etc.).
                <br />
                <br />
                Alongside this navbar class, two other primary classes are used
                within the navBar container to dictate the other features of the
                bar. The class "navLinks" is a class outlining the styling of
                the anchor links within the navigational bar itself. This class
                dictates the look of each link to be representative of a button
                within the bar, and is made to be of width:25% in order to have
                equal distribution of each link for a symmetrical display. The
                class also dictates further styles affecting the text's general
                aesthetic as well such as the 8% padding applied to limit the
                page bounds it reaches. Finally the class "active" is used to
                mimic displaying of the current page to being shown on the
                browser within the navigational bar, highlighting the anchor
                with a different primary colour whilst on the link.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Content Container (Div class: contentContainer)
              <br />
              <p>
                The primary container for displaying content and information.
                Represented in the diagram as the green highlight, the content
                container itself is a parent container within the page to style
                and essentially have all forms of content required be set within
                it's bounds. The class "contentContainer" adds a 12% page margin
                for both left and right to help distinguish itself from the
                navbar and other text on the page.
                <br />
                <br />
                Although the contents of each page may vary vastly, the
                container is used in order to maintain a focused outline of
                where all the various forms of information will be displayed.
                Inside each of these containers except for the home page, will
                have the page start with a &lt;h2&gt; tag with a &lt;hr&gt; tag
                to represent the title of the page. This is to break up what the
                main pieces of information will be pertaining to.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Footer (Div class: footer)
              <br />
              <p>
                The footer banner located at the bottom of each page. This
                footer, highlighted in orange in the diagram, is used to not
                only display information in relation to the author of the
                website as well as the year it was created, but also provide a
                convenient "Return To Top" button located in the right hand
                corner. This button adds a level of accessbility for the user
                interacting with pages of a significant length.
                <br />
                <br />
                The footer is controlled by the "footer" class which dictates
                the general aesthetic of the footer itself whilst also affixing
                it's position within each webpage. This position is also done
                with text being centre aligned. A child class within called
                "footerText" controls the various text stylings for the return
                to top button whilst the "footerDesc" class describes the
                stylings for the description text
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            A further expansion into several key classes used can be seen in the
            table below:
          </p>
          <table class="contentTable">

                  general look of the website without elements.

                  bar. This includes the hover and active effects that are
                  applied to the navbar to mimic the effect of hovering over
                  with a mouse.

                  subsections and layout to distinguish between various areas of
