            The following section details the general analysis of the
            development of the webpages as well as the general concepts followed
            and strategies employed to meet several critieria in regards to the

          <p>
            After working on the creation of each page, the amount of work and
            effort required was significantly more that what I was expecting. I
            had underestimated the difficulty and the sheer extent of work
            required, however after completing these pages, I have a newfound
            respect for the level of attention and detail that is required to
            create a aesthetic and functional page. The work spanned multiple
            days worth of planning and troubleshooting, with the final result
            being the given pages as seen.

          <h3 class="subHeader">Technical Aspects</h3>
          <p>
            The following section outlines the general technical aspects and
            considerations that were taken into account whilst creating each
            page. Several subsections will be used to outline independent
            aspects and components used.
          </p>

          <h4>Website Structure and Outline</h4>
          <p>
            The general website itself consisted of 5 primary files, 4 html
            pages for each respective page of a home page, past page, future
            page and comments page, followed by a singular css stylesheet. The
            following table outlines a brief description for each file:
          </p>
          <table class="contentTable">
            <tr class="tableHeader">

              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>

          <p>
            For each of the respective HTML pages, the general layout was as
            follows in order to create a consistent user experience and easily
            readable site:
          </p>
          <img
            class="commentsImages"
            id="structureImage"
            src="/Assets/pageStructure.jpg"
            alt="Page Structure"
          />
          <p>
            The layout as shown above can be broken down into four major
            components, each with a specified purpose and functionality. It is
            as follows:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Site Header (h1 Tag class: siteHeader)
              <br />
              <p>
                The primary header that is displayed across each page, it is
                shown within the diagram in the blue colour highlight. The
                header itself is used to display the respective subject number
                and subject name. It is displayed within the page as the largest
                element, currently represented by a &lt;h1&gt; tag. The tag
                itself is managed by the "siteHeader" class within the
                stylesheet, and has alignment centred across all pages. It is
                also affected as standard by the "body" styling of the whole
                website, with font-size being enlarged and the font family being
                Verdana.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Navigational Bar (Div class: navBar)
              <br />
              <p>
                The main form of navigation between each webpage. The
                navigational bar is shown across each page similarly to the
                header component, represented as the yellow highlight within the
                diagram. It is represented with the a div container using the
                class "navbar", with several anchor tags within it for traversal
                between pages. Inside this navBar class, the margins, position,
                and general look of the navigational bar itself are all
                configured within the class styling (background-color, border
                etc.).
                <br />
                <br />
                Alongside this navbar class, two other primary classes are used
                within the navBar container to dictate the other features of the
                bar. The class "navLinks" is a class outlining the styling of
                the anchor links within the navigational bar itself. This class
                dictates the look of each link to be representative of a button
                within the bar, and is made to be of width:25% in order to have
                equal distribution of each link for a symmetrical display. The
                class also dictates further styles affecting the text's general
                aesthetic as well such as the 8% padding applied to limit the
                page bounds it reaches. Finally the class "active" is used to
                mimic displaying of the current page to being shown on the
                browser within the navigational bar, highlighting the anchor
                with a different primary colour whilst on the link.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Content Container (Div class: contentContainer)
              <br />
              <p>
                The primary container for displaying content and information.
                Represented in the diagram as the green highlight, the content
                container itself is a parent container within the page to style
                and essentially have all forms of content required be set within
                it's bounds. The class "contentContainer" adds a 12% page margin
                for both left and right to help distinguish itself from the
                navbar and other text on the page.
                <br />
                <br />
                Although the contents of each page may vary vastly, the
                container is used in order to maintain a focused outline of
                where all the various forms of information will be displayed.
                Inside each of these containers except for the home page, will
                have the page start with a &lt;h2&gt; tag with a &lt;hr&gt; tag
                to represent the title of the page. This is to break up what the
                main pieces of information will be pertaining to.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Footer (Div class: footer)
              <br />
              <p>
                The footer banner located at the bottom of each page. This
                footer, highlighted in orange in the diagram, is used to not
                only display information in relation to the author of the
                website as well as the year it was created, but also provide a
                convenient "Return To Top" button located in the right hand
                corner. This button adds a level of accessbility for the user
                interacting with pages of a significant length.
                <br />
                <br />
                The footer is controlled by the "footer" class which dictates
                the general aesthetic of the footer itself whilst also affixing
                it's position within each webpage. This position is also done
                with text being centre aligned. A child class within called
                "footerText" controls the various text stylings for the return
                to top button whilst the "footerDesc" class describes the
                stylings for the description text
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            A further expansion into several key classes used can be seen in the
            table below:
          </p>
          <table class="contentTable">
            <tr class="tableHeader">

          <!-- #region Aesthetic Planning-->
          <h3 class="subHeader">Aesthetic Planning</h3>
          <p>
            With websites being presented to various users, it is given that a
            presentable and and simplistic website is a key part in not only
            providing ease of access to the information being presented, but
            also to appeal to a user's general aesthetic. The goal of keeping
            simplistic yet functional components is to prevent cluttering and
            complications around navigation, keeping user retention focused on
            the positives of the site rather than it's flaws.
            <br />
            <br />
          </p>
          <h4>Colour Usage</h4>
          <p>
            The use of specific colour pallet shown below was to compliment in
            the minimalistic tone that was being conveyed through the site,
            whilst keeping consistency throughout each page to help the process
            of information by presenting certain key components in specific
            colours. The background gradient used was to assist in the appeal
            factor of the site whilst preventing monotonous shades from being
            overused throughout the page:
            <br />
          </p>
          <img
            class="commentsImages"
            src="/Assets/colourSpectrum.jpg"
            id="colourSpectrum"
            alt="Background Colour Spectrum"
          />
          <p>
            The colour pallete used throughout to represent the various features
            such as the navigational bar, tables and other elements was used to
            contrast the background whilst not creating a clash in various
            colour pallets:
          </p>
          <img
            class="commentsImages"
            src="/Assets/colourSpectrum2.jpg"
            id="colourSpectrum2"
            alt="Element Colour Spectrum"
          />
          <h4>Text Colour Usage</h4>
          <p>
            To help present information more consistently, the only two colours
            that were used to present information and text were black and white.
            Some headers were used as white to help portray them has primary
            headers within tables or other elements, however the majority of
            text was done in black to help maintain consistency across the site.
            Certain text that was done in other colours would be hyperlinks
            (presented as the standard colours) or special headers.

          <h4>Font Types</h4>
          <p>
            The font that was chosen for the site was Verdana, for it's
            simplicity and readability. As it is considered a webpage safe font,
            meaning that it is avaialable as one of the stock default fonts
            across a majority of HTML5 sites, the font would very rarely be
            unavailable throughout any browser to be used. However if there were
            any complications, the site would revert to font fallbacks listed as
            Arial or Times New Roman.

            <br />
            <h4>Header Tag Hierarchy</h4>
            The use ofspecific header types was also done in order to help
            maintain consistency across the pages. Layered headers were used in
            order to display titles, sections and subsections throughout each
            page without breaking general hierarchy. The header across each page
            is chosen as a &lt;h1&gt; tag whilst subheadings for each page are
            &lt;h2&gt; (including the home page, just centre justified).

            Alongside the various aesthetic alterations made to help appeal towards the user's interest, several key aspects were integrated to each page for ease of usability of the overall website as well as assisting in the usage of the site. All aspects were considered to follow alongside the guidelines and initiatives outlined by the <a class="inTextLink" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">W3C Web Accessibility Initiative Guidelines</a>.
          </p>
          <h4>Font Sizing</h4>
          <p>
            Fonts throughout the website have been kept as a consistent sizing by specificying that the font-size be "medium". This was done to allow for the text to scale to the windows resolutions and general sizing changes whilst viewed on various devices.

          <h4>Website Structure and HTML usage</h4>
          <p>
            As there are various images throughout the website's multiple pages, and with no confirmation with whether images and other assets would always load in the correct instance, all images were written with and alt name available in order to allow for the website to function without the specific assets in place. Throughotu the site, many standard elements provided by HTML5 were also used in order to not only maintain consistency, but in the chance that the stylesheet is disabled the functionality of the site remains viable. Examples of this include:
            <ul>
              <li>Use of table headers for all tables to distinguish the header from the cell contents</li>
              <li>Consistent usage of headers and the hierarchy as mentioned previously</li>
              <li>Consistent useage of standard tags such as &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;p&gt;</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h4>Various Viewport sizing</h4>
          <p>
            To account for the variety of devices that can be used to view any given webpage, the website itself was designed for each page to have scalable containers in order to prevent issues with viewing on smaller or larger viewports. This was done through the use of percentage margins and padding for each element as well as the main body containers such as "contentContainer" or image scaling. Images were all scaled to only be a set percentage of their maximum size to also prevent these issues from occurring (on majority of deivces, some devices with extremely small viewports will still encounter issues).
          </p>
          <h4>Colour Adjustments and Selection</h4>
          <p>
            The site was designed with the intention of being readily accessible by those who are visually impaired due to forms of colour blindness. As approx 300 million people in the world are affected by varying degrees of colour blindness, the website was designed with the intention of all text and information to be displayed still being legible regardless of severity of impairment. The site has been tested against the <a class="inTextLink" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/daltonize/obcnmdgpjakcffkcjnonpdlainhphpgh/related">Daltonize</a> extension available for Chromium based browsers, to confirm the viability of the colour pallets chosen for the site design.
