          <p class="mainText">
            After checking out my
            <a class="inTextLink" href="index.html">brief intro about me</a> and
            my
            <a class="inTextLink" href="past.html">past experiences</a>
            in the computing area, you may have noticed that much of my
            experience was actually in Electrical engineering first rather than
            a software engineer, IT major or computer science background.
            Nevertheless, even with the various skills and exposures i've had to
            other languages, I still chose to undertake this introductory course
            as I have always felt that having a fundamental grasp of any core
            skill is the most significant in a person's development. This
            applies especially to programming, and with this subject providing
            insight into both the core of frontend development in the form of
            HTML and CSS knowledge as well a deeper comprehension of Linux based
            OS's and the general CLI in Bash, I was easily convinced to jump at
            the opportunity to polish my skills from their core.
          </p>
          <p class="mainText">
            With my skills, I have already achieved quite a successful journey
            in my eyes, having been granted an opportunity to join the Suncorp
            Group's graduate program as a graduate software engineer, and
            provide development knowledge and experience to their ever growing
            list of products.
          </p>
          <p class="mainText">
            Even with this however, I am striving for more opportunities in the
            near future especially if possible within the field of electrical
            engineering still, more specifically in the following areas:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Embedded Software Development</li>
            <li>Renewable Energy System Programming and planning</li>
            <li>Electronics Development</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mainText">
            Given my current path of software development, I am hoping to
            achieve a position by which my technical skills could be polished to
            an extent whereby I am confident in developing in multiple different
            frameworks and languages with relative ease, whilst eventually
            having a comprehensive understanding of Dev Ops skills and general
            knowledge to lead as a team leader or lead developer.
